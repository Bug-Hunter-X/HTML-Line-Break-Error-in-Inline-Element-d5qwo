<p>This HTML snippet demonstrates a common yet subtle error: using a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag inside an inline element.  Inline elements, such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, etc., are designed to flow within a line of text.  The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag, however, forces a line break. This conflict often leads to unexpected layout issues.</p><pre><code>&lt;span&gt;This is some text.&lt;br&gt;This is on a new line (incorrect).&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
